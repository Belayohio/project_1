Project Title: Crypto,Chips, and Market Correlation

Our group consists of Caleb Allen, Belay Hagos, Myroslav Protsiv, and Cyril Varghese. We are doing a project on the relationship of 4 popular cryptocurrencies compared to 4 of the top chip makers. Some questions that we are going to ask is: 
Is there a relationship between chip makers and cryptocurrencies prices
Avg rate of change  of chipmakers vs.crypto
Is there correlation between chip makers and crypto as well as crypto and world market indexes
How do world events impact prices for these things?

We are using an alpaca AI in order to generate historical financial data sets for crypto currencies, top chip makers, and the world market indexes. These will show the open and close prices as well as volume and Volume-weighted average price (vwap). 

Project Description/Outline
With our data sets, we want to find if there is a correlation between the top chip makers prices and crypto prices. We then want to compare this with the correlation of crypto prices and world market indexes prices to see if there is a trend. We also want to look at where there is big volatility and use an api to get what world news events happened that could have led to this. 


Create formula for rate of change for final price
format data so that it goes by weeks and remove rows trade count, vwap, symbol,high, low
 Create visualizations for what questions we want to answer
Set up powerpoint
