Project Title: Crypto,Chips, and Market Correlation

Project Description/Outline:

With our data sets, we want to find if there is a correlation between the top chip makers prices and crypto prices. We then want to compare this with the correlation of crypto prices and world market indexes prices to see if there is a trend. We also want to look at where there is big volatility and use an api to get what world news events happened that could have led to this. We are using an alpaca AI in order to generate historical financial data sets for crypto currencies, top chip makers, and the world market indexes. These will show the open and close prices as well as volume and Volume-weighted average price (vwap). 

Our group consists of Caleb Allen, Belay Hagos, Myroslav Protsiv, and Cyril Varghese. We are doing a project on the relationship of 4 popular cryptocurrencies compared to 4 of the top chip makers. The questions that we are going to ask with analysis is: 

1. Are chip makers and cryptocurrencies prices correlated (avg rate of change in price)?

    Yes, crypto prices and chip makers prices are correlated. As you can see in the graphs of price changes for chip makers and cryptos, between January of 2024 and March of 2024 both of these markets rose significantly with each crypto or chip maker rising by about 50% in their prices. This is then followed by sideways trading in each of the stocks or cryptos other than NVDA and dogecoin which had spikes compared to the others. The reason for this can be described in the next question. 


2. Are there any outliers for any single stock or crypto that might break this correlation?


    Yes, there are some outliers particularly for NVDA and dogecoin. Firstly, for dogecoin there was a massive spike right before March 2024 that led to its price increasing from 30% to 160% in the span of a month or so. When looking up why this was the case on google, this was due to the fact that there was speculation that dogecoin was going to be integrated into X (Twitter) which would drive up the use case for dogecoin. This would make the crypto more valuable as more people would buy and sell dogecoin on twitter (more volume) and it could lead to other platforms to use dogecoin as payment options. As for NVDA, there was a massive surge in the price from April 2024 to July 2024. This all started when NVDA beat earnings expectations by 18% and had an increase in revenue of about 262% from a year ago. This led to more and more buying and in June 2024, NVDA announced a stock split of 10:1 where holders of 1 stock of NVDA would be equivalent to 10 stock shares after June 7th. Both of these news events could be the reason why the NVDA stock continued to rise above the other chip makers and did not follow the trend of other market competitors. 


3. Is there a better correlation between chip makers and crypto prices and world market indexes?
   
	There is a better correlation between chipmakers and the world markets than crypto and world markets. As you can see from the graphs, the cryptos look to rise significantly around March of 2024 and then it trades sideways after that. When you take a look at the price change charts for all the chip makers and the world markets, you can see that there is a steady rise which is similar to the one that world indexes have. Cryptos are more volatile in nature, meaning that they have more swings in price and can go up and down at any moment. This is the reason why it isnâ€™t as close to world market indexes as chip makers. Chip makers are more stable than crypto which allows for steady increases in the prices and this is more aligned with the movement of the world market indexes.

Conclusion:

With our code and in the analysis above, you are able to see that all three Cryptos, Chip makers, and World market indexes all have similar price changes in the same time period of August 2023 to September 2024. There are some outliers such as Dogecoin and NVDA that seperate themselves from their respective groups that are due to external factors such as world news and how they performed as a company.
